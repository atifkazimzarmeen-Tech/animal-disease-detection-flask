# animal-disease-detection-flask
A deep learning project for detecting animal diseases from images using ResNet50 and Flask.
# Animal Disease Detection System using Deep Learning (Flask)

This project is a **Deep Learning–based Animal Disease Detection Web Application** built using **Flask** and **ResNet50**.  
It allows users to upload an image of an animal (Cat, Dog, or Fish) and predicts the disease along with confidence score.
